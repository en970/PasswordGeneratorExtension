This privacy policy explains how the "Secure Password Generator" Chrome Extension handles your data.

## 1. Data We "Collect" (Store Locally)

The extension's "My Passwords" feature allows you to save generated passwords along with a "Name" (e.g., "My Google Account"). This data (Authentication Information) is stored **exclusively on your local computer** using the `chrome.storage.local` API.

We want to be absolutely clear: We (the developers) do not collect, view, store, or transmit *any* of your personal data.

* Your saved passwords **NEVER** leave your computer.
* We do not track your browsing history, user activity, or personal information.
* Your data is never sent to any external server.

## 3. Permissions (`storage` and `clipboardWrite`)

* `storage`: This permission is used *only* to save your passwords locally at your explicit request.
* `clipboardWrite`: This permission is used *only* to copy passwords to your clipboard for your convenience.

## 4. Contact
